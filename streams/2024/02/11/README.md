# Sunday 11th Feb 2024

Hi, I'm Chris (@nomad3k) and today I'm going to be creating my very first crate in Rust.  Never done this before, so looking forward to that.

# Objectives 

[X] Create Calendar library
[X] Code coverage with tarpaulin
[X] Upload to crates.io

# What I learned

* It's incredibly easy to load files into cargo.
* Tarpaulin was erroneously reporting a lack of coverage, for reasons I'm not clear on.
* `#[test_case()]` allowed me to write test cases in Rust.
I have no idea how to debug in EMACS, so switched to VS Code.
