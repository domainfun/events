Welcome
------------------------------

Hi I'm Chris
(@nomad3k).  Please
feel free to ask me
anything.  I'm figuring
this stuff out as well. :)

Monday April 1st 2024
------------------------------

We want to create a UI 
component library, based on
Yew and using Atomic UI as the
convention.

Objectives
----------

[X] Create a temporary Yew
    project
[X] Create a component library
[X] Yew Components
[X] SASS 

What I learned
--------------

* Yew hotloader isn't
  triggered when dependencies
  are updated.
* grass is Rust/Sass library
* trunk can --watch other
  directories, such as
  dependencies
* `cargo-watch` can be used to
  hotload any rust project.
